# US Flights Data for 2008

## Dataset

> This dataset reports flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays for 2008.

> We mainly focuse on the length of delay on arrival because this is what interest the people the most to know what are the most predictive factors to avoid


## Summary of Findings

> We found out that interestingly that most of the flight are not exactly on time but ahead time (even though a bit) and hopefully the number of flights decrees with the increase of the length of delay on arrival

> The distance is not a predictive parameter for the delay on arrival. On contrary, the flight that are the longest are not those who arrive late.

> We found out that the origin cities and destination plays an important role and sorted the ten "worst" and "best one"

> The cause of delay that is the most important is not weather and security plays little role. Mainly it is due to AIrcraft and CArrier but the weather is a good predictive for length of delay.

> It is hard to find the realation between delays and the day of the week.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> I tried to consider that the public interest is to know what cause delays and which parameters to take into account for them in order to avoid it

>The first thing was to show the proportion of delay flight and to relativize the size. using the corrected plot with bins, limit on the intersting value and the scale log

>Then I tried to show the origin and destination cities for which delays are occuring the most in a very simple plot that make clear the conclusion

> I use the same plot that I created in exploration phase to show the relation between delay and distance, days of the weak and reason for delays but I combined those of univariate, bivariate and multivariate for each paramater. For the day of week plot, I limit it to 0-40 minutes delays to show the interresting part.
